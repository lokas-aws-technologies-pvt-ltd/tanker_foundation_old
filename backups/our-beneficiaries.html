<p><strong>Mr. M. Gandhirajan,</strong> aged 49 years resides in Madurai. His wife Mrs. Shanthi is a homemaker. He has a son and daughter who are studying. He works in a Government Co-operative Store on a contract basis and earns Rs. 3,500/- per month. He is the only earning member of the family.  </p>
<p>Mr. Gandhirajan was affected with renal failure 6 years ago due to hypertension. His relative suggested him for homeopathy treatment. He was under homeopathy treatment for 3 years but there was no improvement in his health.His health further deteriorated and  was admitted in ICU in a private hospital at Madurai. He did his Fistula surgery and thereafter continued his dialysis at the same hospital. He has done three fistula surgeries in different locations on his wrist and forearm due to aneurysm. An aneurysm is an abnormal widening or ballooning of a portion of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel.</p>
<p>Initially he could mange his dialysis cost from his own earning. The cost per dialysis in private hospitals ranges from Rs. 1,000/- to Rs. 2,500/- plus consumables. Later on, could not afford his dialysis expenses. He was referred to TANKER through one of our patient of our Madurai  unit. He  joined our Madurai unit on 12th November 2009. He does not have a related donor. He canneither  register for a Cadaver Transplant in Government hospitals in Madurai nor he can afford to register in  a private hospital as the transplant costs are between Rs. 5,00,000 to  Rs.7,00,000. He is thankful to TANKER donors for helping him for his dialysis costs.  </p>

<p><strong>Mrs. B. Nalini,</strong> aged 67 years, resides in Chennai and is a home maker.  She has studied upto IX-Std.  Her husband Mr. Balan, aged 72 years was a Cashier in a tea shop earning around Rs. 3,500/- per month, but right now he is unemployed.  She has three daughters and a son who support her for her dialysis to a certain extent. They live in a rented house.</p>
<p>As a child she suffered from Typhoid, Chicken Pox and Malaria. This could be one of the reasons for her kidney failure, as high strength antibiotic medicines / pain killers were taken for these dreaded diseases. (“Taking over-the-counter painkillers and antibiotics without doctor’s advice could lead to kidney failure”). She was diagnosed with renal failure and was first undergoing dialysis in a private Hospital. As the cost per dialysis in a Private Hospitals ranges from Rs.1000/- to Rs.2500/- plus consumables she was not able to afford her dialysis expenses.</p>
<p>She heard about TANKER’s Subsidized Dialysis Unit through other patients and joined us on 5th April 2002. She cannot register for Cadaver Transplant due to her age.  She is thankful to TANKER donors for helping her with her dialysis costs.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Magudeeswaran </strong> aged 51 years resides at Tirupur. He is unable to work because of his illness. His wife is a private school teacher and earns Rs. 7,000/- per month. They have two school going daughters. He was diagnosed with renal failure due to hypertension. Initially he took care of his dialysis cost with his wife’s support. The cost per dialysis in private hospitals ranges from Rs. 1,000/- to Rs. 2,500/- plus consumables.  He knew TANKER Foundation through our patient and joined our Coimbatore Subsidized Dialysis unit on 23rd December 2013.</p>
<p>He does not have a donor. He cannot register for a Cadaver Transplant as there are no facilities to register for cadaver transplant in Government hospitals in Coimbatore. He cannot register in a private hospital as the transplant costs are between Rs. 5,00,000 to7,00,000. His health has improved greatly after taking regular dialysis in TANKER. He is thankful to TANKER donors for helping him for his dialysis costs.</p>
