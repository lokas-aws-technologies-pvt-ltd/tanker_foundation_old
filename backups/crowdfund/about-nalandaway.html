                                NalandaWay Foundation is a non-profit that works with children from the poorest districts in India, helping them raise their voices and issues through theatre, visual arts, music, dance, radio and films. Over 17,000  children in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir have benefited from our programmes. Our interventions have helped them become creative, learn life-skills and build self-confidence to create the lives that they truly want to lead

                                It was the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat that actually set us thinking. The brutal murder of more than 2000 people, including women and children, made us question the lack of tolerance in society; it also brought forth a realization that something needed to be done to end this violence. In our quest for solutions, we realized that it was children coming in from socially & economically disadvantaged backgrounds who were often rendered helpless and affected by such difficult environments. It was they who needed maximum support and encouragement to articulate their issues and problems. This immediate need for intervention led to the setting up of the NalandaWay Foundation.
